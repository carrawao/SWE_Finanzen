          law or special funds under public law within the meaning of ยง 310 (1) of the German Civil Code (BGB). We shall
          only recognize terms and conditions of the Purchaser that conflict with or deviate from our Terms and
          Conditions of Sale if we expressly agree to their validity in writing.

          should be attached to the order confirmation in any case).

          agreements.
