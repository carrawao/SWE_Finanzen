      4. General information on data processing
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      Scope of the processing of personal data
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      We process personal data of our users only insofar as this is necessary for the provision of a functional
      website and our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users is regularly only carried out
      with the consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases where obtaining prior consent is not possible
      for actual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by legal regulations.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      Legal basis for the processing of personal data
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing operations involving personal data, Art. 6
      (1) (a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis. When processing personal
      data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 (1) lit. b
      DSGVO serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary for the
      performance of pre-contractual measures. Insofar as processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with
      a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 (1) lit. c DSGVO serves as the legal basis. In the
      event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person make processing of personal data
      necessary, Art. 6 (1) (d) DSGVO serves as the legal basis.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the
      interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Art. 6 (1)
      lit. f DSGVO serves as the legal basis for the processing.
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      Data deletion and storage duration
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      The personal data of the data subject shall be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of the storage no
      longer applies. Storage may also take place if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator
      in Union regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. Data will also be blocked or
      deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for
      further storage of the data for the conclusion or performance of a contract.

    <Typography variant='h4' className='pt-4 ps-3 fw-bold'>
      5. Access data
    </Typography>
    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      We, the website operator or page provider, collect data about accesses to the website based on our legitimate
      interest (see Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) and store them as "server log files" on the website server. The
      following data is logged in this way:
    </Typography>
    <List>
      <ListItem>
        - Shares queried
      </ListItem>

      <ListItem>
        - Requested company info
      </ListItem>
    </List>
    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      The server log files are stored for a maximum of 7 days and then deleted. The data is stored for security
      reasons, e.g. to be able to clarify cases of abuse. If data must be retained for evidentiary reasons, it is
      exempt from deletion until the incident has been finally clarified.

    <Typography variant='h7' className='pt-4 ps-3'>
      Unless your request conflicts with a legal obligation to retain data (e.g. data retention), you have a right to
      have your data deleted. Data stored by us will be deleted if it is no longer required for its intended purpose
      and there are no legal retention periods. If deletion cannot be carried out because the data is required for
      permissible legal purposes, data processing will be restricted. In this case, the data will be blocked and not
      processed for other purposes.
